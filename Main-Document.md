# **Mobasher: Real-Time Live TV Analysis System**

## **Executive Summary**

**Mobasher** (مباشر - "Live/Direct" in Arabic) is an open-source, real-time television analysis system designed to capture, process, and analyze live TV broadcasts from multiple channels simultaneously. Using advanced AI technologies, Mobasher provides comprehensive insights into television content through audio transcription, visual analysis, and semantic understanding.

The system addresses the critical gap in systematic television monitoring by providing automated, scalable analysis of broadcast content. Journalists, researchers, media analysts, and civil society organizations can leverage Mobasher's capabilities for media transparency, content analysis, and broadcast accountability.

Built with a focus on Arabic language support and designed for the Kuwait media landscape, Mobasher can scale to monitor multiple television channels in parallel while maintaining real-time processing capabilities.

## **Problem Statement**

Television remains one of the most influential media channels, yet systematic analysis of broadcast content is severely limited:

### **Current Challenges**

1. **Ephemeral Content**: Television broadcasts are transient—once aired, content is lost unless manually recorded and analyzed
2. **Manual Monitoring**: Current media monitoring relies on human viewers, making it slow, expensive, and inconsistent
3. **Limited Coverage**: Comprehensive monitoring across multiple channels simultaneously is practically impossible with manual methods
4. **No Visual Analysis**: Important visual elements (graphics, faces, text overlays) are not systematically captured or analyzed
5. **Language Barriers**: Most existing tools lack proper Arabic language support for both speech and text recognition
6. **Lack of Real-Time Insights**: By the time manual analysis is complete, the broadcast moment and its impact have passed
